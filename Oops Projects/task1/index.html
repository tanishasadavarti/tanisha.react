        speak() {
            console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);

    class Dog extends Animal {
        speak() {
            console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);

    let dog = new Dog('Buddy');
    dog.speak();
</script>

explanation :
1.This JavaScript code defines an Animal class with a speak method that logs a noise based on the animal's name. 
2.It also defines a Dog class that extends Animal and overrides the speak method to make the dog bark.
3.An instance of Dog is created with the name 'Buddy', and its speak method is called, which logs 'Buddy barks.' to the console.
