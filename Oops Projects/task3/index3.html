explanation : 
1.This JavaScript code defines two classes: Vehicle and Car, where Car inherits from Vehicle.
2. Each class has a constructor to set properties (make, model, year) and a method (getInfo) to 
return information about the vehicle. 
3. The Car class overrides the getInfo method to include the year along with the make and model.
4.Finally, an instance of Car is created, and its getInfo method is called and logged to the console, providing details about the car.
